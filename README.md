## shinobi

This branch is for the development of shinobi v1.0.0 which is a complete rewrite of the old shinobi. For the latest stable
version, go to the master branch instead.

## Compiling shinobi

In order to compile shinobi, you need a modern C++11 compiler, which at the moment include GCC 4.8.0 and Clang 3.4 or higher. 
You also require Lua 5.2 or higher for the actual embedding of lua. Boost is also required for Boost.ProgramOptions and
Boost.LexicalCast. The rest of the dependencies are provided under the libs directory.

A build.ninja file is provided (generated by shinobi itself) to compile under g++. Boost and Lua are assumed to be in the
searchable directories.
